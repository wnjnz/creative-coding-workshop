#bakerripley/lessonplans

## October 25th - 6pm - 7:30pm 
### review what we did last time, explain instead of using scratch we will use javascript. 10 minutes
- direct control over specifically how something looks on a website so that we can share 
## drawing in p5js + coding behavior for any key pressed with makeymay minutes 1 hour 
## basic processing with jsbin: template 
-  jsbin template: [JS Bin - Collaborative JavaScript Debugging](http://jsbin.com/fugujo/edit?js,output)

- conversation in how html css and javascript
	- html - content, skeleton
	- css - how it looks, skin
	- javascript - how it behaves, brain
- Shapes - design notebooks - explain the size of canvas system 
	- ellipse
	- line
	- rect
	- text? 
- draw a simple shape - 
	- robot
	- dog
	- snowman

-  keyPressed() 
	- [p5.js | reference](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/keyPressed) - keyPressed with the MakeyMakey -> does something. cycle drawing through colors. 
	- watch out for context switch between script and output

## Debrief - 10 minutes
- programming specific behavior. 
- what is a function? examples of functions

- how do functions behave? how do we change how functions behave?
- why do we need coordinate system? do you think all coordinate systems are the same? where else have  you seen coordinate systems? 
- real life connections - maps, old drawing machines.

## concepts covered/deliverables/goals
- functions are set of instructions that are saved by name
- be comfortable in jsbin environment
- coordinate system
- pixels and screens
- code happens in order 

## materials + equipment
- [ ] makeymakey sets
- [ ] design notebooks
- [ ] colorful pens
- [ ] projector + instructor 
- [ ] one laptop/student

## set up:


## TODO 
- [ ] make handouts for shape syntax 
- [ ] design notebook experience for pseudo coding  - problem solving - what do we need to draw, and are we drawing it with code. 
	- [ ] shape syntax itself
	- [ ] premade shapes
- [ ] design forking experience for initial setup
